- 👋 Hi, I’m Sara Ramaiah, a Research Assistant at Case Western Reserve University in the Burberry Lab in the Department of Pathology. Checkout our lab's GitHub page [here](https://github.com/burberrylab)!
- 🔬 My current work is primarily in applying bioinformatics tools to the study of neurodegenerative disease in mouse models, particularly via single cell RNA sequencing. I am also working on a project using the Reactome database with graph data science algorithms to predict biological relationships.
- 🖥️ I am a Linux enthusiast (my favorite distro is NixOS), and I've done a lot of work on making stable and replicable data science environments for bioinformatics applications with Nix.
